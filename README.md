A [`Docker meetup`](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Lisbon) in Lisbon, Portugal.

### What, Why? Our motivation to pull this off

In a sentence [Docker](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker) is: `An open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container.`
 
Open sourced by dotcloud, now known as docker.inc. 



What we would like to bring with this meetup:
* More members of the Lisbon Dev community to participate in open source projects, specially connected with Docker.
* Create a iterative feedback cycle, letting members share their latest developments and ideas with docker
* Have special training events, so everyone gets up to speed with the technology
